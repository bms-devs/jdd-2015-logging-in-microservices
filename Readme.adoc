= ELK

:experimental:

Playing with https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] in order to setup the famous ELK (https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch], https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash], https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana]) suite.

== Build/Run the stack

Docker-compose is the perviously well know tool called Fig, that is now integrated into Docker +
To launch the stack, clone the repo and issue the following commands :

[source,bash]
----
# build the sample app and its docker image
$ mvn install -f logtest/pom.xml
# Boot all the containers (ELK+App)
$ docker-compose up
----
Hint kbd:[Ctrl+C] to stop the stack

Or use the -d switch to have the stack in background
[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker-compose stop # to kill them all
----

== Shipping the logs

The logstash configuration expect syslog frame with logstash json content on port 5514. +
You can use the logback https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder[logstash encoder] for that purpose.

.logstash.conf
[source,ruby]
----
input {
  tcp {
    port => 5514
    codec => "json_lines"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    host => es
    port => 9300
    cluster => "elk"
    protocol => "transport"
  }
}
----

== Sample application included

There is a small java http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[spring-boot] app in the logtest folder. +
You need to build the application before using docker-compose with a simple `mvn install`

The maven build will create the jar and the Docker image thanks to https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin[Spotify docker-maven-plugin]

Here is the logback configuration for the "logtest" sample application:

.sample logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
...
<appender name="stash"
	class="net.logstash.logback.appender.LogstashTcpSocketAppender">
	<!-- stash is the name of the docker container hosting the logstash instance -->
  <remoteHost>stash</remoteHost>
	<port>5514</port>
	<!-- encoder is required -->
	<encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder" />
</appender>
...
<root level="INFO">
	<appender-ref ref="stash" />
</root>
...
----

Once you have the application up and running (after mvn install and docker-compose up), you can generate logs by performing simple GET request against the following endpoint:
[source,bash]
----
# level can be on of : debug|Ã¬nfo|warn|error
curl http://localhost:8080/logger/{level}
----

== GUIs

The kibana app, a damn great log analysis tools.

* Kibana: http://localhost:8005/ +

Two plugin for ES basic monitoring :

* HQ: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/HQ/
* Whatson: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/whatson/
